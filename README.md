# AnkiAlgo

AnkiAlgo is a platform that aims to be the best way to practice for technical interviews. 

### Spaced Repetition

AnkiAlgo, inspired by [Anki Flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), uses spaced repetition to reinforce concepts and better prepare users for technical interviews.

### Adaptive Learning

AnkiAlgo adapts to the abilities of each user, assigning questions that correspond to their strengths and weaknesses. If a user needed help to solve a problem, conceptually similar questions are assigned in the future to help users recognize important patterns and cement understanding. 

### Staying Disciplined

Staying disciplined in practice is a problem many people face. AnkiAlgo can provide helpful, but not overwhelming, reminders at times when you're free to get some practice in.
